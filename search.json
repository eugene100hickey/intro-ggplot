Our exercises can be done from within the slides themselves. But if you’d prefer to work on a local machine, then….\r\nWe’ll be using the software listed below.\r\nInstall R and RStudio Desktop on your computer.\r\nYou can find step-by-step instructions for installing these here: macOS, Windows.\r\nInstall the following packages:\r\n\r\n\r\n# From CRAN\r\nlist_of_packages <- c(\"tidyverse\", \"ggthemes\", \"carData\", \r\n                      \"scales\", \"showtext\", \"wesanderson\", \r\n                      \"RColorBrewer\", \"viridis\", \"dslabs\",\r\n                      \"gplots\", \"palmerpenguins\",\r\n                      \"gapminder\", \"datasets\", \"HistData\")\r\n\r\n# run the following line of code to install the packages you currently do not have\r\nnew_pkgs <- list_of_pkgs[!(list_of_pkgs %in% installed.packages()[,\"Package\"])]\r\nif(length(new_pkgs)) install.packages(new_pkgs)\r\n\r\n# From GitHub\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"nhs-r-community/NHSRdatasets\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLinks\r\nLink to this website:\r\nAcknowledgments\r\nThis workshop draws from various sources, most notably the books by Kieran Healy and Claus Wilkie. I’d also like to mention the webpage of The Top 50 ggplot2 Visualisations. This workshop ran smoothly with the help of Sharon Townsend as co-pilot.\r\nThis website was made with the distill package. The content was created using xaringan by Yihui Xie, flair by Kelly Bodwin, learnr and xaringanExtra (both by Garrick Aden-Buie), and flipbookr by Gina Reynolds. And special thanks for a custom theme designed by Silvia Canelón.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
