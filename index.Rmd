# Welcome

This is the course site for the _Introduction to ggplot_ workshop created by Eugene Hickey for the [NHS-R Community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/about/).

This six-hour hands-on workshop will be a gentle introduction to  [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html) package as a tool to create impressive graphics and data visualisations.

- **The Morning** will discuss the overall structure of [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html) and we'll start doing some initial plots; barcharts, boxplots, histograms, point/line plots.....

This workshop is designed for people with previous experience of R but have yet to take the plunge to working with ggplot.

# Prework

## Essential

We'll be using the software listed below.

- Install [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) on your computer. 

You can find step-by-step instructions for installing these here: [macOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM88tYlEy_g), [Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRKmZK5-6aE).


- Install the following packages:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# From CRAN
list_of_packages <- c("tidyverse")

# run the following line of code to install the packages you currently do not have
new_pkgs <- list_of_pkgs[!(list_of_pkgs %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new_pkgs)) install.packages(new_pkgs)

# From GitHub
devtools::install_github("nhs-r-community/NHSRdatasets")
```

This workshop draws from various sources, most notably the books by [Kieran Healy](https://socviz.co/) and [Claus Wilkie](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/). I'd also like to mention the webpage of [The Top 50 ggplot2 Visualisations](http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html). This workshop ran smoothly with the help of [Sharon Townsend](https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/author/sharon-townsend) as co-pilot.

This website was made with the [distill package](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) and a custom theme designed by Silvia CanelÃ³n.
