This six-hour hands-on workshop will be a gentle introduction to  [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html) package as a tool to create impressive graphics and data visualisations.

- **The Morning** will discuss the overall structure of [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html) and we'll start doing some initial plots; barcharts, boxplots, histograms, point/line plots.....

This workshop draws from various sources, most notably Alison Hill’s [Making Slides with R Markdown](https://arm.rbind.io/slides/xaringan.html) and Greg Wilson's [Teaching Tech Together](http://teachtogether.tech/en/). This workshop ran smoothly with the help of [Laurie Baker](https://lauriebaker.rbind.io/) as co-pilot.

This website was made with the [distill package](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) and a custom theme designed by Silvia Canelón.
