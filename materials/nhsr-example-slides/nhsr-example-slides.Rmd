Hello! My name is NHS-R Community and I'm excited to be here promoting the use of R in the NHS.

# About NHS-R Community

The NHS-R community aims to support the learning, application and exploitation of R in the NHS through workshops, video tutorials and providing a platform for discussion and sharing of developing best practice solutions to NHS problems.

With funding support from the Health Foundationâ€™s Advancing Applied Analytics programme (which is aimed at improving analytical capability in support of health and care services.) The Improvement Academy & University of Bradford will lead this initiative  with support from NHS Improvement, NHS Midlands and Lancashire Commissioning Support Unit & NHS Wales Delivery Unit.

# Outline

----

.pull-left[

Outline slides like this one are commonly found in the wild. If they incorporate links they can become a useful "table of contents" for a slide deck.  

Downside is they aren't very memorable. I would encourage a "roadmap" approach to your presentations, using interesting transition slides that let your audience know where you've been and where you're going next.

# Bullets and text color

* first point

* second point

You can emphasize text with color:

* .blue[Blue]
* .green[Green]
* .pink[Pink]
* .red[Red]
* .warmyellow[Warm Yellow]

--

And make it **bold** or _italicized_ using Markdown:

* .blue[**Bold** or _italicized_]
* .green[**Bold** or _italicized_]
* .pink[**Bold** or _italicized_]
* .red[**Bold** or _italicized_]
* .warmyellow[**Bold** or _italicized_]

# Tables and quotes

### Table
.pull-left[

`NHSRDatasets::LOS_model`

Artificially generated hospital data. Fictional patients at 10 fictional hospitals, with `LOS`, `Age` and `Date status` data. 

Data were generated to learn Generalized Linear Models (GLM) concepts, modelling either `Death` or `LOS`.

# Code highlighting

`This is what inline code looks like highlighted within text`

Lines within code chunks can be highlighted using the trailing comment `#<<`, as seen below:

### Code

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
NHSRdatasets::LOS_model %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Organisation)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = Organisation)) +    #<<
  nhsrtheme::scale_fill_nhs("highlights")     #<<
```
````

### Output

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
NHSRdatasets::LOS_model %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Organisation)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = Organisation)) +    #<<
  nhsrtheme::scale_fill_nhs("highlights")     #<<
```
